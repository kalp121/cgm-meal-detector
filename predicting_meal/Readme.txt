Overview: There are two matlab files which are used for data_preprocessing and four python files which are machine learning models.

Steps to run a program:
1) Copy your test data(csv file) into 'Scripts and data' folder.

2)Open 'preprocess_test.m'(Matlab file) and change the filename to your copied csv file in the first line.

3)Run 'preprocess_test.m'. Which will automatically create/update 'test_data.csv' file in the directory.

4)Run python scripts.These .py scripts calls predict funtion which returns a list with predicted labels.
